# fourdimensions
fourdimensions.js is a tool for visualising 4-polytopes. It is extensible (although a bit of a pain to extend) and uses three.js as a display library. My main references in creating fourdimensions.js were [Four-Space Visualization of 4D Objects](http://steve.hollasch.net/thesis/index.html) by Steven Hollasch and [this site on interpreting projections from 4 dimensions](http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/vis/vis). You can see the script in action [here](https://wizzeh.com/dimensions.php).
